# What are Dotfiles?
Personalizing your Linux or any Unix-based system is done with dotfiles, which are customisation files.  A dot will appear at the beginning of the file name, indicating that it is a dotfile!  A hidden file or directory can be identified by the period at the beginning of its name.  These are my own dotfiles in this repository.  For my convenience, they are kept here so I can easily access them on fresh installs or new PCs.  Some of my configurations might also be useful to others who want to customize their own dotfiles.

# Who Am I?
Hello, my internet name is CrankyTechDad -- Cranky for short. I am a father. The latter is more important to me; however, like you all that you care about, and rightfully so, is that I am a content creator. I am the creator of the CrankyTechDad TikTok Channel. My goal with CrankyTechDad is to not only hopefully entertain, but also educate. I hope to educate users on how to leverage Linux and Free and Open Source Software as well as general advice and tutorials about other software and operating systems. I give them a peak behind the curtain and hope to educate them on how to get involved in the technology industry.

When I am gone and no longer with him, I hope these videos that I produce nearly every day, will give my family solice and let them see the man I was when I wasn't in front of them. I want them to see their father and husband was trying to help humans every day with either a laugh or a skill to better themselves. Additionally, I hope the videos and files will give them something to look back on and see me through -- like a time capsole.

I have many backups of every memory imaginable. One day, they will come in handy for them to enjoy -- hopefully (LOL).
